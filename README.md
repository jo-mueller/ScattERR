# ScattERR
This project is part of the development of processes and analytical methods for high-precision irradiation of small animals with protons. This script improves the setup of proton irradiation. With the appearing user interface one can handle three different axes with two scatteres on it (one scatterer can only move in horizontal direction and the other one in horizontal and vertical direction).  Also after measuring the dose profile of the beam, one can adjust the second scatterer to improve the homogeneity of the dose field for a better irradiation of biological cells.
